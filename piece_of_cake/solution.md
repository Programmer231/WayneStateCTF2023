# Piece Of Cake

Code:

```
enc_flag = ""
flag = ""
import key

#key is 1 ASCII character
assert(len(chr(key)) == 1)

for each in flag:
    each = chr(ord(each) ^ key)
    enc_flag += each

with open("flag.enc.txt", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(enc_flag)
    print(enc_flag)
```

The first clue we have to solving this is that it looks like every character in the flag is being XOR'd
by a key that we don't know.

```
assert(len(chr(key)) == 1)
```

This line of code tells us that the key has a length of 1 and is within the range of 0-255 due to calling char() on the key.
(We know that this key is 1 ASCII character)

## Solution

We can try brute forcing the key by trying every possible ASCII character. Here is the script for the solution:

```
with open("flag.enc.txt", "r") as infile:
    flag = infile.read()

for i in range(256):
    test = ""
    for each in flag:
        each = chr(ord(each) ^ i)
        test += each
    try:
        print(test + '\n')
    except:
        continue
```

After running this script, we get the output:
